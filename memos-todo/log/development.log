ActionView::Template::Error (Webpacker can't find test.js in /home/ubuntu/memos-todo/memos-todo/public/packs/manifest.json. Possible causes:
1. You want to set webpacker.yml value of compile to true for your environment

2. webpack has not yet re-run to reflect updates.
3. You have misconfigured Webpacker's config/webpacker.yml file.
4. Your webpack configuration is not creating a manifest.
